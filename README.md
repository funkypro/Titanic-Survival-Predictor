# Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢

## Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning (Decision Trees) to predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers based on features like Age, Sex, and Class.

## Data Cleaning Steps
* Handled missing values in 'Age' using **Median Imputation**.
* Dropped 'Cabin' due to 70%+ missing data.
* Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values.

## Model Performance
* **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier
* **Accuracy Score:** 79.89%%

## Key Insight
The model identified 'Sex' as the most significant driver of survival, accounting for 60.57% of the predictive power
